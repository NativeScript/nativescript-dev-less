LESS CSS pre-processor for NativeScript projects.
=======================================

## `nativescript-dev-less` is deprecated in favour of  `bundle` workflow, which will be introduced with CLI v6.0. More info about the upcoming new approach can be found [here](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/the-future-of-building-nativescript-apps). 

How to use
----------
```
$ tns install less
```

The above command installs this module and installs the necessary hooks. LESS CSS pre-processing of all `.less` files inside `app` folder happens when the project is prepared for build.
